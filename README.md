# Semaphore Abstraction Library in Python

This project is a simple abstraction library for semaphores in Python. It provides a basic interface for creating and managing semaphores, which are a synchronization primitive used to control access to a shared resource.

## Features

- **Simple Semaphore Creation**: Easily create semaphores with a specified initial count.
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Ensure thread-safe operations on the semaphore.
- **Resource Pool**: Manage a pool of resources using semaphores.

## Installation

```bash
pip install semaphore-abstraction
```
